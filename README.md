Kubernetes Architecture Explained!

Understanding Kubernetes Components & Structure
Introduction
Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration platform, designed to efficiently manage large-scale containerized applications. It follows a distributed architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, and consistency across clusters.

For beginners, Kubernetes can seem complex. This guide simplifies its architecture, breaking down its core components.

Kubernetes Architecture Overview
Kubernetes has two main parts:

Control Plane â€“ Manages the cluster and schedules workloads.

Worker Nodes â€“ Run containerized applications.

The control plane ensures high availability and fault tolerance, while worker nodes execute application workloads.

Key Kubernetes Components
Control Plane Components
1. Kube API Server
Acts as the cluster's central communication hub.

Processes API requests from users and internal components.

Stores cluster state in etcd, a distributed key-value store.

2. Kube Scheduler
Assigns new pods to suitable worker nodes.

Considers resource needs, node affinity, and availability.

3. Kube Controller Manager
Runs multiple controllers to maintain cluster health.

Examples: Node controller, Deployment controller, and Job controller.

4. Cloud Controller Manager
Integrates Kubernetes with cloud provider services (e.g., storage, networking, load balancing).

5. etcd
Stores Kubernetes cluster data.

Ensures consistency and high availability.

Worker Node Components
1. Kubelet
Runs on each worker node.

Ensures containers are running and healthy.

2. Kube Proxy
Manages network routing and load balancing for services.

3. Container Runtime
Runs containerized applications (e.g., Docker, containerd).

Add-ons
Enhance Kubernetes functionality (e.g., monitoring, logging, networking).

Summary:

Control Plane manages the cluster.

Worker Nodes run application workloads.

Core components (API Server, Scheduler, Controllers) ensure stability.

etcd stores cluster data reliably.

Kubelet & Kube Proxy manage application execution and networking.

This simplified breakdown helps in understanding Kubernetesâ€™ architecture and functionality. ðŸš€
